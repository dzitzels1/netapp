# These scripts were developed by me for my current environment.
# While they may work in other environments with slight to no modification, there is no warranty that they will.

# As my environment changes, I will post updates.  These updates may or will break the script for your particular environment.
# It is recommended that you thoroughly test run the script in a non-production lab environment prior to using in a production environment at any level.  Use at your own risk.
# Also be sure to test any changes thoroughly in a non-production lab environment.

# I am not responsible for any issues that may arise through the use of my scripts outside of my own environment.
# My scripts are posted as a help or a template only - not a full solution.
